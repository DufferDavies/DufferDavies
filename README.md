- 👋 Hi, I’m @DufferDavies
- 👀 I’m interested in mathematics, (theoretical) physics, operational research (OR) and software development.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on percolation.  To be specific, I am investigating the analytical behaviour of the site percolation probability on finite, square lattices of increasing size.
- 💞️ I am certainly open to the idea of co-operating, if you too are interested in percolation theory.
- 📫 If you'd like to contact me about any of my areas of interest, please feel free to drop me a line at DrMathewDavies@yahoo.com.
